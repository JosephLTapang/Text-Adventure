You see the demolished remains of a door and above it a rickety sign
 labelled hergwerts magicians department. Looking closer you see a note
 from ferderx about the successful delivery of one golem murderizer.

You are in a room that smells like science but looks like a blast
 zone. The floor is littered with glass and wood shards but you can
 still see a large glyph on the floor. A sign next to it reads..Magical
 combine items glyph..But only really combines three specific items.
 there is a door going west from here. You see a h2o-potion on the
 floor. You see a o2-potion on the floor. You see a gas-potion on the

The glyph flashes under your feet as the contents of the glass vial
     begin to bubble and froth. You pop the cover on and slip it in
     your pocket like any other magician would.walk west

You are in a dark room that gives you a peculiar feeling of being
 murderized. That feeling materializes into reality as what you once
 thought was a column in the middle of the room begins to move. You
 vaguely remember the demolished door and bowed steps of the staircase.
 you are jolted from your moment of thought as a gate slams closed
 behind you. Turning around you realize that where the column was now
 stands a golem. The furnace within its chest crackles with fire and
 begins to burn brighter as it preps to run its clobber you algorithm.
 if you have a glass-vial full volatile fluid and a teleport-scroll now
 would be a good time to activate it.activate teleport-scroll glass-vial

At the end of your frantic recital of the teleport-scroll you see the
 glass vial from your pocket fling itself out of your pocket and
 towards the golem. The golem shields its chest but the vial blinks out
 of existence. Both you and the golem stand around in confusion until
 you notice the vial managed to plant itself into the furnace of the
 golem. At the exact moment you see this there is a bright flash of
 light followed by the sound of metal and rock twisting and collapsing
 to the floor. The golem is no more and you have to make a call to
 ferderx. The end.
