Which parts of the project did you code? debug? did you generate output? 
Added objects and locations to code. 
Coded interactions of items.

Debugged win and lose condition not activating.
Debugged or changed item interaction and existence that did not make sense.

What did you contribute to creating the game?
Modified code from the Land of Lisp text and wrote new code for new actions. 
Brainstormed the level design and how specific items should interact.
Determined what the end goal was and how it should be achieved. 

Did you create the characters and locations of the world?
The characters and locations are somewhat of a parody of Hogwarts and that wizard
universe. But most of the items and locations are not directly lifted from Harry
Potter. 

Did you write part of the manual or flyer?
I created the idea for the flyer, drew it by hand, and used GIMP to color it in.
I wrote the manual and added the graphics as well.
